## Installation

eCal is currently only supported on Windows but will make its way to other operating systems like MacOS.

1. First, go to the installation page [here](https://github.com/rishaank/eCal/releases) and download the installer.

2. Windows might mark the file as unsafe multiple times. If you trust this app, you can ignore these.
